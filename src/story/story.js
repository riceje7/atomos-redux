				message: "Welcome User! My name is Talus, I have been sent here to guide you on your journey through the digital world of ATOMOS! Unfortunately, all is not well in Atomos. You have been brought here under terrible circumstances, and your journey is a perilous one. I'm afraid a virus has been injected into the system and has begun wreaking havoc, it has even transformed the programs of Atomos into terrible, evil creatures called the Nata. The programs of Atomos need you User! Defeat the Nata, transform them back into their true forms, and restore order to Atomos. To help you defeat the Nata, I have scattered POWER-UPS throughout the sectors of Atomos. You will need to collect these power-ups to learn how to manipulate the code of Atomos and the Nata themselves. Taking down a fearsome Nata won't be easy at first, but it will get easier with each power-up you collect. Each time you collect a power-up you will get some info about it and how it can be used. Read carefully, because until you learn to save that information you won't be able to recall it incase you forget something. Your first power-up is just ahead, however you'll need to defeat your first Nata before you can acquire it. Don't worry though, I'll help you in your fight. Press 'Enter' to continue."
